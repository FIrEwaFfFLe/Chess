# Chess

Install a python interpreter; install the pygame library; run "frontend.py".
First, input a number - the depth of the AI that you want (0 for no AI, 2 player with board flips). If you're playing AI, then enter 0 for you playing the white pieces, and 1 for the black ones.

P.s. - when you promote a pawn, type Q, R, N or B in the terminal, standing for the name of the piece you want to promote to.

P.p.s. - for MacOS users, replace "sprites/" in frontend.py lines 53, 58, 116, 122 with "Chess-main/sprites/".
